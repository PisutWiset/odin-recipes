# Odin Recipes Project

## Introduction

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, focusing on building a basic recipe website. The goal is to create a simple, functional website that displays a collection of recipes. This project will serve as an introduction to fundamental HTML skills, emphasizing the use of basic HTML tags for structuring content, creating lists, and working with images and links.

## Skills Demonstrated (Anticipated/Post-Completion)

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated proficiency in the following HTML skills:

* **Basic HTML Structure:** Creating a valid HTML document with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
* **Text Formatting:** Using headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and other text-related tags.
* **Lists:** Implementing unordered (`<ul>`) and ordered (`<ol>`) lists for presenting recipe ingredients and instructions.
* **Images:** Embedding images (`<img>`) with proper `src` and `alt` attributes.
* **Links:** Creating hyperlinks (`<a>`) to navigate between pages and external resources.
* **File Organization:** Structuring project files and folders logically.
* **Basic HTML Semantics:** Choosing appropriate HTML elements to convey meaning and structure.
* **Commiting good readable code:** Making sure that the code is easy to read, and follow.
