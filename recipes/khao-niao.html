    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Khao niao, also known as sticky rice or sweet rice, is a staple in Lao and Thai cuisine, especially in the northern and northeastern regions of Thailand (Isaan). It's distinguished by its opaque grains, which become wonderfully sticky and slightly sweet when steamed. Unlike regular rice, sticky rice contains a higher amount of amylopectin, the starch responsible for its characteristic texture.</p>
    <p>This simple yet essential dish is often served alongside grilled meats, spicy salads like som tum (papaya salad), and flavorful curries. Its slightly sweet flavor and satisfyingly chewy texture make it a perfect accompaniment to a wide variety of Thai and Lao dishes. Preparing khao niao traditionally involves soaking and then steaming the grains, a process that yields a uniquely delicious and comforting rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups glutinous rice (sticky rice)</li>
        <li>Water, for soaking</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the glutinous rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps to remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>Soak the rinsed rice in enough water to cover it completely for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. The grains should absorb a significant amount of water and appear plump.</li>
        <li>Drain the soaked rice completely using a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth-lined colander.</li>
        <li>Prepare a steamer. Traditionally, a cone-shaped bamboo steamer is used, but any steamer with a tight-fitting lid will work. Make sure the water level in the bottom of the steamer is below the steaming basket.</li>
        <li>Line the bottom of the steamer basket with cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel to prevent the rice from falling through the holes.</li>
        <li>Pour the drained rice into the lined steamer basket, spreading it out evenly.</li>
        <li>Cover the steamer tightly and steam the rice over medium-high heat for 20-30 minutes, or until the grains are translucent and have a sticky texture. Stir the rice gently halfway through the steaming process to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, the khao niao should be slightly shiny and very sticky. Serve hot or at room temperature with your favorite Thai or Lao dishes.</li>
